    <p>This $270,530 coupe pays fitting tribute to the almost-sacred V8 engines that have powered the automaker’s
        most successful cars since its first mid-engine V-8, all the way back to the 1975 Ferrari 308 GTB. With a
        3.9-liter, 711-horsepower engine, a perfect seven-speed gearbox, and 568 pound-feet of torque, it’s more
        powerful and efficient than its predecessor, the 488 GTB. The F8 Tributo weighs less than 3,000 pounds and
        is lethally quick: zero to 62 mph in 2.9 seconds, with style to spare. </p>

    <p>This is the mid-cycle refresh of the Huracan Spyder line, but it feels like the one you'd want out of the entire
        lot, thanks to its plus accoutrements for longer drives: ambient light packages, smartphone interfaces, electric
        seats, and “Lamborghini telemetry” for an enhanced driving feel as you round those hairpin turns. The trunk is
        small as a pillbox, and the chassis is stiff enough to make you sore; but the thrill of driving it removes any
        lingering doubt. The steering is so light and precise, it feels as if the car could tango across a tightrope;
        the brakes grab with the security of a bank vault. The $287,400 Huracan Evo does zero to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds.
        Top speed is 202 mph. Total power is 631hp, 29 hp more powerful than its siblings. Most important, it uses
        computer “logic” to sharpen or soften the response of the steering, the brakes, and the chassis, according to
        the style of the driver. The system makes 50 adjustments per second, based on 240 different inputs such as how
        the car rolls, pitches, accelerates, steers, and brakes; it anticipates desires, based on habits, and adjusts
        accordingly to changing conditions—much like a well-trained butler, but better looking. </p>
